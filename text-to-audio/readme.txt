### USAGE:

Here's how to use the Text to Speech button shortcode:

1. **Basic Usage:** Simply add the following shortcode anywhere in the content of your page or post to insert the text-to-audio button.
	
	`[atlasvoice]`

2. **Customize Button Text:** You can customize the text displayed on the button by adding attributes to the shortcode. For example:

	`
	[atlasvoice listen_text="Listen" pause_text="Pause"  resume_text="Resume" replay_text="Replay"/]
	`

3. **Custom Text to Read:** To specify custom text for the button to read aloud, use the ‘text_to_read’ attribute in the shortcode. For example:

	`
	[atlasvoice text_to_read="Hello WordPress" /]
	`

4. **Add CSS Class:** You can also add a custom CSS class to the button by including the ‘class’ attribute in the shortcode. For example:

	`
	[atlasvoice class="custom_class"/]
	`	
5. **Change Language and Voice:** Alter the language and voice of the text-to-speech by using the `lang` and `voice` attributes in the shortcode. For example:

	`
	[atlasvoice lang="en-GB" voice="Google US English"/]
	`	

6. **Adding Missing Content:** If there is missing content that you want to include, you can do so using a filter. Here's an example of how to add extra content via a filter:

	`
    add_filter( 'tta__content_description', 'tta__content_description_callback', 10, 3 );
    function tta__content_description_callback ( $output, $description, $post_id ) {

		$output .=" extra content here";
		
		return $output;
    }
	` 

7. **Use ShortCode As Tag:** You can use `atlasvoice` as tag. Like

	`[atlasvoice ]This is example content [/atlasvoice]`
	


These shortcodes and attributes provide flexibility in customizing the text-to-audio functionality on your WordPress and WooCommerce sites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Text To Speech Support All Android Phones ? =
Yes, Text To Speech supports all Android phones. However, full support is exclusively available in the [pro version](https://atlasaidev.com/plugins/text-to-speech-pro/). The free version has certain limitations. Here's what you need to know:
Text To Speech TTS plugin relies on the browser's API, with no external API used. The [speechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) API varies from browser to browser and device to device. Consequently, voices and languages may differ based on the browser used.
For example, a language available on a desktop may not be available on a mobile phone, and a voice available on a desktop may not be available on Android. In that case, the browser will play the default voice it supports.
Overall, your users will still be able to listen to the content from almost all devices despite the voice change. If you encounter any browser-related issues, please submit a [ticket](https://atlasaidev.com/contact-us/) for assistance.

= Does Text To Speech Support My Language? =
Text To Speech Pro TTS Accessibility supports these [languages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/text-to-audio/#:~:text=PRO%20SUPPORTED%20LANGUAGES%3A).

= Does Text To Speech Support Multilingual Plugins ? =
Yes, the [pro version](https://atlasaidev.com/plugins/text-to-speech-pro/) of the Text To Speech plugin currently supports __WPML__, __TranslatePress__ and __Gtranslate__. We plan to extend support to
[Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/), and [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) soon.


= Does Text To Speech Support Custom Post Types ? =
Yes, [pro version](https://atlasaidev.com/plugins/text-to-speech-pro/) of Text To Speech plugin supports custom post types.


= Content Missing From Post =
If content is missing from your post, you have multiple options to add it dynamically. In the pro version, you can utilize CSS Selectors, which allow you to target specific elements on your pages and posts.

To use CSS Selectors, navigate to the Settings menu of the plugin and add the relevant selectors under **Add CSS Selector**. These selectors can span across multiple pages, offering dynamic content addition. This method offers flexibility compared to filters, which are static in nature.

Additionally, you can add missing content through filters. Here's an example of how to do it:
1. Install the plugin [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)
2. Select "Snippets" and then "Add New."
3. Create a new snippet with the following code:

`
add_filter( 'tta__content_description', 'tta__content_description_callback', 10, 3 );
function tta__content_description_callback ( $output, $description, $post_id ) {

	$output .=" extra content here";
	
	return $output;
}

` 

This filter allows you to append extra content to your posts dynamically.

= Can I Restrict/Exclude Certain Words From Playing? =
Absolutely! You have the flexibility to exclude specific content from being read aloud, and this feature is available in the [pro version](https://atlasaidev.com/plugins/text-to-speech-pro/) of Text to Speech.

Here's how to exclude words from playback:

1. Navigate to the Settings tab of Text to Speech Pro.

2. Look for the "Exclude Texts To Speak" textarea.

3. In this field, you can list the words or phrases you wish to exclude from being read aloud.

4. If you want to exclude multiple words or phrases, simply separate them using the pipe symbol (|).

With this capability, you can fine-tune the playback experience, ensuring that only the desired content is read aloud to your audience.

= Is it possible to exclude specific HTML tags from being read aloud by the Text to Speech plugin? =
Of course! With the [pro](https://atlasaidev.com/plugins/text-to-speech-pro/) version of Text to Speech, you gain the ability to skip the content enclosed within certain HTML tags during playback.

**Here's how it works:**

*Navigate to the Settings tab of Text to Speech Pro.

*Locate the "Exclude Tag's Content" textarea.

*In this field, you can specify the HTML tags whose content you want to exclude from being read aloud.

*If you need to skip multiple tags, simply separate them using the pipe symbol (|).

By utilizing this feature, you can tailor the reading experience to your preferences, ensuring that specific HTML elements are omitted from the audio playback.

= How to add a button in the Gutenberg block? =
To incorporate a listening button via the Gutenberg block editor, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Gutenberg block editor for your page or post.
2. Search for the "Customize Button" block.
3. Add the block to your content.
4. Customize the button by adjusting parameters such as color, background color, and width.
5. Optionally, apply custom CSS to further tailor the button to your preferences.


= How to change button text? =
You have two methods to modify the button text. One is by utilizing shortcode attributes, and the other is by adding a filter. However, please note that filters always take precedence over shortcode attributes.
Shortcode Example:

	`
	[atlasvoice listen_text="Listen" pause_text="Pause"  resume_text="Resume" replay_text="Replay"]
	
	`

Filter Example:
Install the plugin [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/), then navigate to Snippets > Add New. Create a new snippet with the following code block:

`
	add_filter('tta__button_text_arr', 'tta__button_text_arr_callback');
	function tta__button_text_arr_callback($text_arr) {
		return [
			'listen_text' => 'Listen',
			'pause_text'  => 'Pause',
			'resume_text' => 'Resume',
			'replay_text' => 'Replay',
			'listen_hover_title' => 'listen title',
			'pause_hover_title' => 'pause title',
			'resume_hover_title' => 'resume title',
			'replay_hover_title' => 'replay title',
		];
	}

`
  
Replace 'Listen', 'Pause', 'Resume', and 'Replay' with your desired custom text.
            
= How to add custom CSS class to button? =
You can add a custom CSS class to the button by including it as an attribute in the shortcode. Here's an example:

`
[atlasvoice class="custom_class"]

`

Replace "custom_class" with the name of your desired CSS class. This allows you to apply specific styling to the button using your custom CSS rules.


= How to  change button background and text color? =
You can easily customize the button background and text color directly from the plugin's dashboard customization menu. Additionally, you have the option to modify these settings using the customization button block in the block editor.

= How to change voice and language by shortcode? =
You can customize the voice and language of the text-to-speech player using shortcode. Here's how:

	`
	[atlasvoice lang="en-GB" voice="Google US English"]
	`

= Where do I report security bugs found in this plugin? =

Please report security bugs found in the source code of the Text To Speech TTS plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure  Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/e8df1af0-74f2-41c7-bb59-d72a3898e234).
